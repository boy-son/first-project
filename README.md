## Code Refactor

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Changes Made
- restructured HTML to follow a semantic flow.
- consolidated tags that had the same information.
- added alt text to all images.
- restructured CSS sheet so that it flows top to bottom.
- added comments to CCS sheet to explain the functions of each element.

## End Product
